## Claude - Setting up the landingpage after logg in to the secure access page.

We are going to make some changes to this file: login_client.html. Add a global variable called 'LandingPage'. Set it to 'landingpage.html' After a successful login open the web page stored in the 'LandingPage' variable.
Also pass the user_id, username, login_status to the landingpage.

Edit
I'll add the global LandingPage variable and modify the login success behavior to redirect to the landing page with the user information.

Perfect! I've successfully updated the login client with the following changes:

Changes Made:
Added Global Variable:
Added const LandingPage = 'landingpage.html'; at the top of the script section
Modified Login Success Behavior:
Instead of showing the dashboard after successful login, the application now:
Shows "Login successful! Redirecting..." message
After a 1.5-second delay, redirects to the landing page with URL parameters
User Information Passed to Landing Page:
user_id: The user's ID from the login response
username: The user's username
login_status: Set to 'success' to indicate successful login
How It Works:
When a user successfully logs in, the application will redirect to:

landingpage.html?user_id=123&username=john_doe&login_status=success
The landing page can then access these values using JavaScript:

javascript
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const userId = urlParams.get('user_id');
const username = urlParams.get('username');
const loginStatus = urlParams.get('login_status');
This approach maintains the user session information and provides a smooth transition from the login page to the landing page, while giving the landing page all the necessary information about the authenticated user.
