## Claude - Update Profile tab.

Add a third tab to the login_client.html file with the caption 'Update Profile'.
Make this tab invisible, only make it visible when needed.
Add all of the fields on the 'Register' tab to the 'Update Profile' tab.

Perfect! I've successfully added a third "Update Profile" tab to the login_client.html file with all the requested features:

Changes Made:
1. Added Third Tab:
Caption: "Update Profile"
Visibility: Hidden by default (style="display: none;")
Position: Third tab after Login and Register
2. Complete Update Profile Form:
All Register fields: First Name, Last Name, Username, Email, Password, Confirm Password
Security Questions: Same structure as Register form
2FA Toggle: Same functionality as Register form
Token Expiration: Same options as Register form
QR Code: Same 2FA setup display
3. Smart Tab Management:
Tab visibility: Update Profile tab only appears after successful login
Tab switching: Enhanced switchTab function to handle three tabs
Form state: Update Profile form doesn't reset when switching (preserves loaded data)
4. Integrated Functionality:
Auto-populate: Form fields are pre-filled with current user data after login
Placeholders: Show current values as placeholders for better UX
Validation: Password confirmation only validates if password is provided
API Integration: Uses existing user update endpoint
Dashboard refresh: Updates dashboard after successful profile update
5. User Experience:
Login flow: After login ? Dashboard shows ? Update Profile tab becomes visible
Logout flow: Update Profile tab hides again on logout
Seamless navigation: Users can switch between tabs without losing session
Now users can:

Login ? See dashboard with Update Profile tab available
Click Update Profile tab ? See form pre-filled with current data
Make changes ? Submit updates
View updated info ? Dashboard refreshes with new data
Logout ? Update Profile tab disappears
This is much cleaner than the separate landing page approach!
